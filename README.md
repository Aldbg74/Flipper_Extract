<h1>Extract</h1>

This project demonstrates a simulated data exfiltration process using a USB Rubber Ducky in a controlled, ethical hacking environment. The purpose is to showcase how common techniques for data extraction can be implemented and to highlight potential vulnerabilities in systems, encouraging stronger security practices.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

The USB Rubber Ducky is utilized to automate the execution of commands on a target device. This step simulates how an attacker could gain access to sensitive data through social engineering or physical access. For demonstration purposes, the USB Rubber Ducky's payload is designed to collect non-sensitive information, showcasing the ease of automation in data gathering.

<h2>Key Components</h2>

    USB Rubber Ducky: A USB device that automates scripted commands on a target system, 
    mimicking a potential real-world attack where data 
    could be extracted if the system is compromised.

<h2>Project Details</h2>
Here you get some details of the project. <br>

<h3>Rubber Ducky</h3>
The Rubber Ducky Folder contain : <br>

- The Duck Scrypt used to the target computer : <br>

This scrypt will launch a action who take all needed data, and send them to a docker container. <br>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ruber Ducky script isn't encoded in the format used
> by the usb key

- Dockerfiles to extract files to a docker container <br>

> [!CAUTION]
> All testing should be conducted only on systems you own or have explicit permission to use.
> Extract files shou be conducted in a safe local environement.

<h3>Other</h3>
Nothing to see here. <br>
